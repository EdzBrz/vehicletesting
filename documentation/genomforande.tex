\section{Execution of the project}
\subsection{Scrum and how it has been used}
It was decided back in november that the entire project would be divded into three sprints.
The exact dates were to be decided in the beginning of each sprint.
In cooperation with the client the scope of the project and the scope of the first sprint was decided upon in november.
During the first projectmeeting the first sprint goal was divided into eight sprint stories.
It soon became clear that those eight stories were way to big, at the end of the sprint none of the stories had been finished.

Lesson learnt, the second sprint was divided into smaller stories which gave immidiate result when the first 69 sprint story points finished during the second sprint.

To decide upon size for each sprint story, for the second and third sprint, "planning poker" \cite[p.~42]{kniberg07} was used.
For every sprint story each project member wrote down an estimate on the scope for each story.
With planning poker it became clear that each project member had a different vision for each story.
A short discussion after each estimate made it more clear on how big the scope was, an agreement was usually made within a few minutes.

\subsection{One project, three sprint goals}
As mentioned earlier the project was divided into three sprints.
This meant that three different sprint goals had to be divided into smaller sprint stories which in turn had to be assigned to a project member.
Due to all project members being new to most of the tasks at hand the first team division was made with focus on components \cite[p.~106]{kniberg07}.
The goal with this was that each smaller team within the project could sit together and dive deep into their specific part such as the Mulle, the server parts or the android code.
Later on a split into cross-component teams \cite[p.~107]{kniberg07} was aimed for but due to some persistent bottlenecks in some components this was never done.

For all sprints the sprint planning meeting were used to categorize each sprint story into the different components (Mulle, Server, Android).
It was then up to each component based team to split their stories between themselves.
This ended being a very flexible solution, in some cases, to flexible when a team didn't use the Scrumboard online at Scrumdo.com the team could wander off from the sprint story they were supposed to work on.
For the last sprint everyone got at least one sprint story assigned to themselves directly during the sprint planning meeting.
This was made to put more focus on using the Scrumboard at Scrumdo.com.

A move to cross-component teams was never made instead an attempt to increase speed for the Mulle and the Android component was made by moving one team member from the server team to the Mulle team and another to the Android team.
The server component at this time was way ahead of the other components.
Another week later it became clear that the additional team member for Mulle team was not needed, cause the problem was still a bottleneck that only one or two team members could work on at a single point in time, a move back to the server team was made.

\subsection{Reflection about Scrum usage during this project}
%TODO: Nya uppdelning av sprints. 2 veckor konfiguration, git, latex, gcc, eclipse osv. 2 veckor uppstart av sjalva koden(litteraturstudier testkodning osv), sedan välja coapy eller c-lösning på server.
%Sedan en kortare spint pǻ 3 veckor med kodning. Avslutningsvis 2 sprints på 5 veckor. Totalt 17 veckor.
%TODO: Tydligare sprint mål för varje sprint från kravställare.
%TODO: Tydligare importance från kravställare av varje sprint story.
%TODO: Tydligare 
%TODO: Relationen till våran kund har inte varit optimal mest kommunikation har skett med text. Svårt att boka in sprint planning möten så ingen kravställare närvarade på sprint planning meeting, all kommunikation var istället brandsläckning i form av att lösa bottlenecks problem.
%TODO: Vi skulle ha satt ner foten på hur många delar vi skulle jobba med samtdiigt. Startat med Mulle och Server enbart...sedan android i mån av tid för att få mer fokus i projektet, vi var trots allt bara sju personer.
%TODO: Ingen "experthjälp" med android tillgänglig. I detta läge gör det stor skillnad om man är två, tre eller fyra. Varje programmerare ökar hastigheten med mer än bara sin tid hen kan lägga till eftersom felsökning oftast går betydligt snabbare på fler personer än enbart två.Många fel beror också på utvecklingsmiljön, om man är fler så är det större chans att någon har stött på problemet tidigare och har en lösning.
%TODO: Reflektion över flytten av individuella team members server till mulle och android. Väldigt "dyrt" i uppstartskostnad.

\section{Execution of the project}
\subsection{Scrum and how it has been used}
It was decided back in november that the entire project would be divded into three sprints.
The exact dates were to be decided in the beginning of each sprint.
In cooperation with the client the scope of the project and the scope of the first sprint was decided upon in november.
During the first projectmeeting the first sprint goal was divided into eight sprint stories.
It soon became clear that those eight stories were way to big, at the end of the sprint none of the stories had been finished.

Lesson learnt, the second sprint was divided into smaller stories which gave immidiate result when the first 69 sprint story points finished during the second sprint.

To decide upon size for each sprint story, for the second and third sprint, "planning poker" \cite[p.~42]{kniberg07} was used.
For every sprint story each project member everyone wrote down an estimate on the scope for each story.
With planning poker it became clear that each project member had a different vision for each story.
A short discussion after each estimate made it more clear on how big the scope was, an agreement was usually made within a few minutes.

\subsection{One project, three sprint goals}
TODO: Vi delade in oss i tre olika grupper, mulle, server och android under ett skype-möte.
TODO: Efter sprint planning första två gångerna var det upp till varje "grupp" att fördela uppgifter.
TODO: Under andra sprinten flyttade vi resurser från server-delen då den var långt före de andra delarna.
TODO: Flyttade tillbaka en resurs i början av tredje sprinten eftersom det fortfarande var svåra flaskhalsar vi satt fast med på Mullen...onödigt att tre sitter fast på samma ställe.
TODO: Sista sprinten tog var och en direkt en uppgift från sprint backlog och satte den mer tydlig som "sin". Detta ledde till viss förbättring men eftersom vi inte har dagliga scrum möten så ger det inte en daglig uppdatering/reflektion över hur det faktiskt går...sprint backloggen blir inte en del av vardagen.

\paragraph{Stories}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{"Create a PHP-web page that presents information stored in the database."}

I had no experiences in creating a web page so I estimated that it would take me about eight hours, first to learn the basics about html, php and css, and then to implement it. It took me about 12 hours, I believe it took longer time because of the problems I had with retrieving data from the database and that I decided to split the php file containing the finished web page into three parts header, main and footer to make it easier to add to the page. 

\item {"Add button to the web page that can call Mulle-services on the server"}

I had some experience with php now so I estimated that it would take me about four hours, which was about what it took for me to create a php form, understand how it works and connect it to a python script that can call Mulle-services. I believe that since I had worked with php before it made it easier to estimate time. Furthermore if the the button I made had not been turn on/off lamp, whose services is not implemented on the server, it would have taken me longer time to finish because the python script I created need information about the service to call to work fully. 

\item {"Create a database that keeps track of connected/active devices."}

I estimated that I would take me about eight hours, since I had no experience with databases, more than retrieving information from one. It took me about six hours, the reason to why it was created quicker than expected was because I had few problems and I did not have the possibility to test it with a Mulle due to its communication problems.
